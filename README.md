# Analysis
Analysis for Glendinning Hall, Holland College transactions/reservations for the summer. June 1st-August 23rd inclusive.

# Things to note
The way payment works in Glendinning Hall is as follows: Cards are pre-authorized upon reservation of a room, and cards are then billed only at the time of check-out. Generally speaking, pre-paying is discouraged as it messes with the usual flow of the hotel, but possible. Keeping a record of transactions is valuable as it helps determine days where someone prepaid (and there was an overage that day), and subsequently days where there was a shortage as there had been a pre-pay previously. It is possible to cross-check check-out information with transaction information to figure out which days were considered, in a sense, 'Problem Days'.

# Transaction files
The transaction CSV files are from the WebRez system used by Glendenning Hall.

# Check-out files
The check-out PDF files are also from the WebRez system. It is only possible to get a PDF file of the check-outs of the day, not multiple days at once. 
PDFMerging.py is used to merge these PDF files together into a single one.
